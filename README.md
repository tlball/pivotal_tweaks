# Pivotal UI Tweaks
Minor modifications to make Pivotal work better for you

## Features

### Suggest Branch Name
When expanding a story, this extension will append a row beneath the `actions`
section (the section with the link and id for your story). This new row lists a
`BRANCH IDEA` which is a suggestion for what you should name your corresponding
branch. This suggestion is generated by concatenating the story id with a
lower-cased, dash-delimited version of the story title. This suggestion is a
button, and when you click it, the suggestion will be automatically added to
your clipboard for easy pasting when creating your branch.

#### Shortened name
Sometimes the names get rather long. To the right of the branch name, there's a new
branch icon. When this icon is clicked,  a chopped down version of the branch name
(40 characters) will be copied to your clipboard.

## Known Issues
This extension reuses the copy-to-clipboard functionality that already exists in Pivotal.
Because of this, the helper text that displays on a successful copy of the branch name
will not correspond with the what was just copied. For example, it may say
"Story URL copied" even though you copied the branch name.
