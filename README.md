# Pivotal UI Tweaks
Minor modifications to make Pivotal work better for you

## Features

### Suggest Branch Name
When expanding a story, this extension will append a row beneath the `actions`
section (the section with the link and id for your story). This new row lists a
`BRANCH IDEA` which is a suggestion for what you should name your corresponding
branch. This suggestion is generated by concatenating the story id with a
lower-cased, dash-delimited version of the story title. This suggestion is a
button, and when you click it, the suggestion will be automatically added to
your clipboard for easy pasting when creating your branch.
